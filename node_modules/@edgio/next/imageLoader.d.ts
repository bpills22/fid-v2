/**
 * This is a custom loader for next/image
 * that is used to optimize images with new Edgio Image Optimizer powered by Sailfish.
 *
 * Images on relative paths can be optimized directly.
 * Images on remote hosts are first proxied through the user's lambda
 * using Edgio Image Proxy (see NextRoutes.ts) and then optimized by Sailfish Image Optimizer.
 * The Edgio Image Proxy is used to validates the remote patterns from next.config.js
 * and proxies only allowed URLs.
 *
 * When Edgio Image Optimizer is disabled, this loader is not used
 * and images are optimized by next's built-in image optimizer.
 *
 * NOTE: This loader runs on both server and client side,
 * so don't use any browser/node specific APIs here.
 *
 * See plugins/withImageLoaderConfig.ts for more details and
 * https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/images
 * for more information about image loaders.
